## 🚀 My North Star
> To build products and insights that make data *actionable* — turning analysis into innovation, and innovation into real impact.

I believe great decisions come from great data, and great products come from people who care enough to turn that data into something *useful, beautiful, and scalable.*

## 💥 What Drives Me
| Focus | What It Means to Me | Example |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| 📊 **Analytical Thinking** | Using data to *reveal what others don’t see* — finding the “why” behind every number. | Built predictive models at Welltower uncovering 15–20% ROI lift and optimized $MM CapEx budgets. |
| 🧭 **Product Mindset** | Translating insights into *delightful experiences* and measurable business outcomes. | At Kuaishou, led A/B tests and UX redesign → +25% conversion uplift & +35% user retention. |
| 💡 **Entrepreneurial Drive** | Taking initiative to *build from 0→1*, where vision meets execution. | Launched “Carpooling Mini Program” in WeChat — product ideation, MVP, and rollout for corporate commuting. |

## 🌍 My Vision
> I build systems that connect insight and action — using data to inspire smarter products,  
> and using products to make data truly meaningful.

I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and a bias toward impact.  
Whether optimizing millions in CapEx or designing a new carpooling app,  
I always start from the same question: **“How can this create measurable value for people?”**
